![screencapture-localhost-3000-2024-04-10-22_51_53](https://github.com/harshkhavale/aeonaxy-MultiStepForm/assets/91471322/5cd477f8-ae04-46d2-a6a9-693b07cb6a3a)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## key features
Multi-Step Form: The core feature of the project is the multi-step form itself. It breaks down a potentially lengthy or complex form into smaller, more manageable steps.

Well-Structured Components: The project utilizes well-structured React components to organize and manage the form's various sections and fields. Each step of the form is encapsulated within its own component, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Responsive Design: The form is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it displays properly and remains functional across a variety of devices and screen sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Tailwind CSS Styling: The project leverages Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for rapid prototyping and consistent design elements throughout the application. Tailwind's utility-first approach enables quick customization and flexibility in styling components.

Font Awesome Icons: Font Awesome icons are integrated into the project to enhance the visual appeal and usability of various elements within the form, such as buttons, input fields, and navigation controls.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
